# PDCv2 Development Kit

This repo hosts all the scripts required to get you started using the development kit for our PDCs.
The development kit consists of a ZCU102 FPGA board, two adaptor boards and two 2x2 heads for detection.

![Assembled development kit](documentation/images/devkit_assembled.jpg)

The complete setup will make use of an host computer communicating with the ZCU102 via Ethernet to for control, configuration and data acquisition.
We recommand reading through the [ZCU102 Getting Started Guide](./documentation/gettingStarted/zcu102.md) for a better undestanding of how the setup works before plugging everything and start using it.
A better understanding of the platform might help troubleshoot issues you may have on your setup.

## Getting started

To get started using the platform, you will need a Linux computer with an Ehternet port or USB dongle, an SD card and a SD card reader.
For Linux, recent debian-based LTS distributions and red-hat based distribution are supported (i.e. Ubuntu-20.04, Ubuntu-22.04, Ubuntu-24.04, Almalinux 8).
Here are the list of the steps required to get the setup up and running.

1. Clone this repo on the PC you want to use as host (if you are new to git, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
2. Fetch the `img.tar.gz` file from the release tab of this repo then extract. This archive contains the `*debian_image.img` to flash your SD with.
3. Flash the SD card with the image `*debian_image.img` provided in the repo. This can be done with [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or other equivalent programs/tools.
4. Insert the SD card in your ZCU102 board and connect it via Ethernet to the host. Power-it on. 
5. Run the script `setupHosts/setup.sh` to install required packages and configure the host computer. Feel free to look at it to understand what has been installed and configured on you PC. After this has run, you should be able to communicate with the ZCU102 board and FPGA and connect to it by running `ssh zcudev`.
6. Activate the created python environment: `source ~/venv_pdcv2/bin/activate`.
7. To test communication with your PDCs, connect the heads using the blue cables to the adaptor board, power-on the adaptor boards, and run the test script `hostApps/python/validatePDCCommunication.py`. 
You can do so by placing the power switch towards the ZCU102 ([view image](documentation/images/adaptor_board.jpg)). 
These tests will only validate the communication with the digital core of the chips without enabling any SPADs.
7. Everything, should work. If not, you can read through the [ZCU102 Getting Started Guide](./documentation/gettingStarted/zcu102.md) to help you troubleshoot where the issue might be.
Don't hesitate to contact us to help you debug your setup.

## Host Computer scripts

This repo contains an suite of scripts to help you setup basics functionalities of the PDC. 
There are some helpers to start and monitor the application mentioned in the [ZCU102 Getting Started Guide](./documentation/gettingStarted/zcu102.md) (dataReader, dma2h5).
The only prior steps to running these steps is having the setup script on the host beforehand and mounting the NFS folders on the ZCU102 through the `setup-zynq` script (see [ZCU102 Getting Started Guide](./documentation/gettingStarted/zcu102.md) section 1.10).

```

These should help you visualize incoming information from your PDC and develop new appliations tailored to your setup.
New scripts might come in the future to help you develop more complex setups, either developped by the team at Sherbrooke or other user of the platform.
